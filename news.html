As Kawaki officially joins the Team 7 the Boruto anime has moved to its next original arc titled “The Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc” where the Team 7 has been given the task to escort Katasuke to the Land of Water to attend a ceremony. There they are joined by an old friend Kagura. However, they are suddenly attacked by a Terrorist group that holds grudge against the Land of Water.

  <br>
In the midst of the ceremony that was being conducted in the Land of Water, an airship suddenly gets blown up<br>. Once Boruto finds out about the incident, he tries to immediately head over to the scene of the crime. But right at that same moment, someone has launched jid an attack upon the prison that Boruto is currently visiting.
<br>
Together with Kagura, Boruto decides to go and engage the enemy head-on. Even though they had finally just been reunited with one another – since it had been quite a long time since they last met during Boruto’s<br> school field trip – Boruto and Kagura form a united front. Will the two of them be able to thwart their enemy’s scheme to break out Funato Araumi, who is currently jailed at the facility and is the leader of a pirate gang?
